Business Use Case: Healthcare Data Analytics with Hive Partitioning and Bucketing
Problem Statement
A healthcare organization processes vast amounts of medical records, patient visits, and prescription data. This data is used to analyze healthcare trends, such as:
1. Patient Visits by date and region.
2. Top Prescribed Drugs in different regions and time periods.
3. Patient Demographics analysis for targeted health programs.

Given the large scale of the dataset, querying the data for reports becomes slow without proper optimization. The organization wants to:
- Optimize queries to retrieve data based on visit date and region for reporting purposes.
- Speed up queries for specific prescription drug trends and patient demographics.
- Use partitioning and bucketing to manage the dataset efficiently in Hive, improving query performance and storage optimization.
